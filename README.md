## About

<img src="./public/images/camille-brodard-f6Wpz1QPFZI-unsplash.jpg"/>

I developed an online gourmet product store using Next.js and Typescript. I used Node.js for the server-side and got inspiration from a commercial website for healthy supplements for the project's design.


## Tools

- TypeScript
- React.js
- Tailwind
- Next.js
- MongoDB

## Goals

To develop using a more typed language, become familiar with Next.js using its main tools, and practice Tailwind. I also plan to implement authentication, checkout, shopping cart, and a blog in the project. The challenge included dealing with different layouts for desktop and mobile and using Typescript, which, while helpful in error prevention, also brought typing challenges.
